/**
 * This package contains custom moves which can be used by the
 * OptaPlanner-Engine. Instead of just using moves that just
 * change one variable of an entity at a time, the custom
 * * moves can change everything in an event and even swap events.
 * This helps avoiding local optima in the solving process.
